Don't let salesmen talk you into anything that is unaffordable. Sports cars look nice and you can be sweet talked into such a purchase. This dealer is working for a commission, so your money is his or her money. Stick with what you can afford.

Keep in mind that car salesmen have some monthly quotas to meet. Use this against them by shopping at month end. Salesmen who haven't yet met their quote will be more willing to negotiate. This may make negotiations easier.

When buying a compact or subcompact car, make sure that it has enough room for each person who will drive it.

Buy Cars

Many people who have bad credit end up at a buy-here pay-here dealership. Be very careful of these types of dealers. Usually they buy cars at auction for little money and the majority of the money they make is off of the high interest rates they charge. If you have any choice, always get a loan from a bank, not the dealership.

Do not buy cars that have been through floods. You can find out if the car has been in a flood by doing a history search for it. You can also learn if it was a lemon buyback, or if it has been in a serious accident. Not all accidents will cause the car to carry an R title, so research the history prior to purchase.

Car shopping with knowledge will set you apart from your peers. The tips here are a great start. This way, you will really have a good time purchasing your next vehicle.
